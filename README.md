# Prediction-on-hepatitis-dataset
Life Prognosis of hepatitis is quite a challenging task in early stage due to various interdependent features. A model can be developed which can be used in prediction of life prognosis of hepatitis disease. Data mining refers to extracting or “mining” knowledge from large amounts of data. Data mining techniques have been extensively used in bioinformatics to analyze biomedical data. Data mining algorithms can be used efficiently in prediction and classification of inter-related data. The objective of this analysis is to classify and scaling the accuracy of hepatitis.  Rapid Miner is the most widely used data mining tool which support huge amount of data mining algorithms for classification and regression. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is the most widely used data mining algorithm in the field of medicine. Feature selection techniques are used to obtain dominant set of attributes.
